/*Create a program that solves the N-Queens problem for any given N using backtracking. The
program should print all possible solutions for placing N queens on an N x N chessboard so
that no two queens threaten each other. This task requires you to use a recursive function to
place queens row by row , and a validation function to check if a queen can be placed in a
specific cell. If a placement leads to a conflict, the algorithm should backtrack to the previous
row and try a different column.*/
