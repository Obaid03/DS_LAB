/*Task #3:
Design a program to handle marks of students in different courses using a jagged array
(since each student is enrolled in a different number of courses).
=> Input the number of courses each student takes.
=> Dynamically allocate memory for each student accordingly.
=> Calculate and display each studentâ€™s average marks.*/
